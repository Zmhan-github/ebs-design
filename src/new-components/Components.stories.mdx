# Get started

EBS UI is a reusable component library that helps build UIs faster. The goal is to make building strong UI more simple and productive.

## Install

EBS UI components are written in React, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format]

Add EBS UI to your project.

```bash
npm install @ebs-integrator/react-ebs-ui
```

yarn add @ebs-integrator/react-ebs-u
```

### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

```javascript
import { Button, Badge, Icon } from '@ebs-integrator/react-ebs-ui';
```

and use them like so

```javascript
const Example: React.FC = () => (
  <>
    <Button type="primary" size="large">
      Do something
    </Button>

    <Badge count={1}>
      <Icon component={IconSVG} />
    </Badge>
  </>
);
```
